The main aim of this project is to predict the house price based on various features
#  Lifecycle In A Data Science Projects
1)Data collection

2)Data cleaning

3)Data Analysis(EDA)

4)Feature Engineering

5)Feature Selection

6)Model Building

7)Evaluvation and accuracy checking

8)Model Deployment

Since the dataset is taken from kaggle no need of datacollection.
# EDA + datacleaning
There were some missing values.And the continous varibles were skewed .We created some plots and tables to look at the data
# feature engneering
since the data contains missing values we removed missing values with appropriate way.And some varibles were skewed we applyed log transformation
and minmax scaling to all dataset at the end after handling the missing values and skewed varibles
